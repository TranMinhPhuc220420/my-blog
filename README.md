FastAPI Backend + Next.js Frontend + MongoDB

---

## ðŸŒŸ What This Project Does
This project provides a full-stack web application template with the following features:

- **Frontend**: A modern, responsive user interface built with Next.js.
- **Backend**: A robust API server powered by FastAPI.
- **Database**: MongoDB for efficient and scalable data storage.

### Key Use Cases:
- Quickly set up a full-stack application with minimal configuration.
- Develop and test APIs with FastAPI's interactive documentation.
- Build and deploy modern web applications with Next.js.
- Seamlessly integrate with MongoDB for data persistence.

## âš¡ Development

| Command | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `make up` | Start all services (FE + BE + MongoDB) |
| `make up-build` | Build then start |
| `make down` | Stop all services |
| `make build` | Rebuild services |
| `make logs` | View realtime logs |
| `make prune` | Clean unused docker volumes |

## ðŸ“¦ Production (Suggestion)

In production, you should:
- Use production-ready builds:
  - Frontend: `npm run build` and serve.
  - Backend: run `uvicorn` without `--reload`.
- Use environment variables for database connections.

Example production docker-compose file can be added separately.

---

## ðŸ›¡ Notes
- `docker-compose.override.yml` is auto-applied in development.
- Hot-reload is enabled for both frontend and backend.
- `node_modules` are excluded from bind mount to prevent issues.
